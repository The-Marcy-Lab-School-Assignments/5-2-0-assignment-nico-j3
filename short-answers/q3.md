# Question
What is polymorphism? Show an example in a code snippet.

# Answer
Polymorphism is when objects will have different behaviors, but it have the same functionality.

```js
class Pet {
    greet() {
        console.log(`hello`)
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    greet(){
        console.log('pspsps')
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    greet(){
        console.log('here doggy')
    }
}
```
